What is SnakeZFS
================
SnakeZFS is a simple Python script for performing ZFS snapshot and send/receive 
operations. 

A typical use case is to run with a cron job at regular intervals, sending
the backup(s) to a remote server via SSH.

Compatibility
=============
Interfaces with standard ZFS and bash commands, so it should work on most Linux 
and Solaris-based operating systems. Developed and tested on Debian, Archlinux, 
and OpenIndiana.
